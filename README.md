# AIEN - AI ENhancement script
DCS World AI enhancement script for ground units

**AIEN** (AI ENhancement) is a script that improves the default ground AI actions in DCS World. AIEN features include: 
- Suppression. AI is suppressed first when taking fire from any source;
- Reactions. AI that have been hit or taken damage will perform intelligent reactions, such like evading fire, taking cover, call for support and much more;
- Infantry dismounting. Infantry squads get out of units such as APC, IFV, Trucks;
- Automated artillery fire missions are given to artillery groups detected beyond Line of Sight (LOS).

**USAGE INFORMATIONS**:
- The script does not require any other script to run;
- Load the script in a "do script file" trigger after at least 3 seconds from mission start;
- Script is designed to have a very low performance impact during gameplay, but reading the manual is recommended about this;
- It's easily customizable: you can choose which feature turn on or off, you can choose if it will affect one or both coalitions, you can choose if one or more groups won't be considered.

**COMPATIBILITY** 
AIEN is compatible with: DSMC, Mist, MOOSE, LoATC, CTLD, CSAR, IADS script, Gamemaster, Olympus.
AIEN controls ground units. Whilst AIEN works with the following script frameworks, it may conflict with any script that routes AI and works best where AI has been given a single destination.


**NOTES**:
- The script does not need set-up or additional coding besides the user customization variables setup below;
- It alter the ground groups behaviour and any change will effectively "broke" any other actions given by DCS or CA user when kicking in (and that's just normal and ok).
- The script do not use any naming convention (except for the exclusion tag), it will define available AI behaviour change using DCS available parameters such as unit attributes, skills, etc.
- you will be able to customize each of its "features", by enhabling and disabling each option you want to use, here below
