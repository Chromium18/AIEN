--[[ GROUND UNITS AI ENHANCEMENT -- AI-EN

This script is possible thanks to the existence of many other scripts that I had the opportunity to use as inspiration, or partial copy, or modification due to being publicly available.
I basically learnt coding starting with mist, CTLD, SLmod, dismount script, and else. All credits goes to these authors, and I am very grateful. Therefore this script is obviously public
and you should feel free to use it totally, partially or anything else for any DCS gaming purpose.

What is it?
This script is done with the purpose of rehearsing the standard DCS ground groups and units AI, 
implementing additional behaviours using the SSE, aiming to get some more dynamic and realistic
response of those units to the environment and users actions.

The script currently is focused on ground units, except SAM and medium-to-long range air defences which are not being commanded.

This works mostly by changing 2 common behaviours: 
- the fact the the units basically do not react to any hostile fire moving elsewhere: the script provide movement decision
- the fact that artillery units fire only when they directly achieve a target, which is mostly unlikely: the script provide targets on arty groups via allied units informations

It also act on another important thing on ground war: dismountable soldiers' teams. By rehearsing an idea of MBot dismount script,
AIEN add soldier teams to any IFV, APC and trucks unit in the scenery. That means that a ground unit normally "unarmed" like a M-939 
might in fact transport RPG, rifle and even manpads units that will dismount from it when necessary to respond to specific menace.

In the end, if you need a specific group or more to do NOT be altered by the script, you simply have to add the exclusion tag (AIEN_xcl_tag string variable) in their group name: they will be completely ignored.


Usage informations:
- The script does not require any other script to run;
- Load the script in a "do script file" trigger after at least 3 seconds from mission start;
- The script does not need set-up or additional coding besides the user customization variables setup below;
- It won't be properly compatible with any other script that try to change the AI behaviours for ground movers. It should be ok with IADS scripts;
- It alter the ground groups behaviour and any change will effectively "broke" any other actions given by DCS or CA user when kicking in (and that's just normal and ok).
- The script do not use any naming convention (except for the exclusion tag), it will define available AI behaviour change using DCS available parameters such as unit attributes, skills, etc.
- you will be able to customize each of its "features", by enabling and disabling each option you want to use, here below  

Purpose and limitations:
- AIEN dismount feature (see below) can't be run along with CTLD or CSAR script, to avoid conflicts on on-board troop management. For this reason, you should disable the dismount option if you use CTLD or CSAR or both. If you don't, there's still an automated check that will disable AIEN dismount itself if you forgot it.
- The script does not want to provide a complete "automated ground war" thing: this is already in development by both ED and also by DSMC 2 script by me. In fact, this script is also a part of the DSMC 2 script, but still usable externally as standalone.

-- Action sets allowed.
AIEN.config.firemissions        = true      -- true/false. If true, each artillery in the coalition will fire automatically at available targets provided by other ground units and drones
AIEN.config.reactions           = true      -- true/false. If true, when a mover group gets an hit, it will react accordingly to its skills and to its situational awareness, not staying there taking hits without doing nothing
AIEN.config.suppression         = true      -- true/false. If true, once a group take fire from arty or air and it's not armoured, it will be suppressed for 15-45 seconds and won't return fire. Require reactions to be set as 'true'
AIEN.config.dismount 		    = true 		-- true/false. //BEWARE: CAN AFFECT PERFORMANCES ON LOW END SYSTEMS // Thanks to MBot's original script, if true AI ground units with infantry transport capabilities (mainly APC/IFV/Trucks) will dismount soldiers with rifle, rpg and sometimes mandpads when appropriate
AIEN.config.initiative 		    = true 		-- true/false. If true, the ground groups will take limited initiative of attack or advance if intel and terrain allow them
--AIEN.config.conquer 		    = true 		-- true/false. If true, the ground groups will look for nearby towns or DCS ground markers and will try to move there if intel and terrain allow them (this is limited in space cause it's designed to work appropriately with DSMC 2)

-- User advanced customization
AIEN.config.AIEN_xcl_tag		= "XCL" 	-- string, global, case sensitive. Can be dynamically changed by other script or triggers, since it's a global variable. used as a text format without spaces or special characters. only letters and numbers allowed. Any ground group with this 'tag' in its group name won't get AI enhancement behaviour, regardless of its coalition 
AIEN.config.AIEN_zoneFilter     = ""    	-- string, global, case sensitive. Can be dynamically changed by other script or triggers, since it's a global variable. used as a text format without spaces or special characters. only letters and numbers allowed, i.e. "AIEN" will fit. If left nil, or void string like "", won't be used. Only groups inside the named trigger zone will be affected by AIEN script behaviors of reaction, dismount and suppression, and vice versa. If no trigger zone with the specific name is in the mission, then all the groups will use AIEN features.
AIEN.config.message_feed        = true 		-- true/false. If true, each relevant AI action starting will also create a trigger message feedback for its coalition
AIEN.config.mark_on_f10_map     = true 	    -- true/false. If true, when an artillery fire mission is ongoing, a markpoint will appear on the map of the allied coalition to show the expected impact point
AIEN.config.skill_action_const  = false     -- true/false. If true, AI available reactions types will be limited by the group average skill. If not, almost 2/3 of all available actions will be always be available regardless of the group skills
AIEN.config.maxGroupInMovement  = 10        -- number, used to limit the maximum number of groups that can be in movement at the same time. If more than this number are in movement, the script will not allow new movements until one of them is finished. This is useful to avoid too many groups moving at the same time and causing performance issues.

--###### COUNTER BATTERY FIRE ######################################################################

local function counterBattery(hitPos, tgtPos, coa) -- this function emulates counter battery fire
    -- this function is not about simulating the counter battery fire process, which involves projectiles radar detection,
    -- balistic calculations and then defining a shooter position. Instead, for performance purposes, the process is "hinted" using the following method, and start only if the shooter is an "indirect fire" attributes units
    -- this way:
    -- * first, since we don't want to do calc, we took the shooter current position when the hit event occours, to use it later if allowed, called tgtPos   
    -- * second, same reason, we pre-check if a free arty is available in range for fire on shooter position.
    -- * if arty is ok, and given the hit position, we look for the presence of a suitable radar ("SAM SR", "SAM TR", "EWR" since DCS world doesn't have the right kind of unit) within 50km 
    -- * if it's there, since we don't want to do calc much, we simply apply some random math formula that depends on distance as a probabilty of trajectory calc IRL and, also, the accuracy
    
    -- * if the random pass, the tgt is the passed for arty fire after a random timing that is counterBatteryPlanDelay+-35%.

--###### MISSION REACTIONS #########################################################################

--[[ Reactions is probably the most important behaviour change you will notice using this scripts. Reactions are (currently) triggered only by an hit event on one of the group unit. 
    Obvioulsy optimizable, the code structure basically works this way:
    1. when the hit event happen, some info are gathered in the event function event_hit that will launch executeReactions
    2. the function executeReactions basically will "try" to execute each of the below actions, in a priority order defined in the event_hit
    3. before defining priorities, all these functions are "filtered" by group skills (less skilleg group won't have the most refined solutions) and prioritized by conditions and available informations
    4. the first function that return as a "success" is then executed, and the behaviour take place.

    Side note: suppression, dismount (of all or only manpads) effect are NOT dependand to the scoring model and will take place in parallel.

--###### MISSION TACTICAL ACTIONS ##################################################################

--[[ Tactical actions are tasks that are issued by C2, given intel and own forces informations, in real time, to reposition ground units at medium ranges (up to 15 km unless you change AIEN.config.tacticalRange) 
    While initiative is up to the single group with only it's own informations and targets detected, tactical actions are issued by C2 to reposition MBT, IFV, APC and ATGM groups in a more effective way, using the information available to the coalition

    While optimizable, the code structure basically works this way:
    1. For each non-tasked and not under attack group entry, it looks for intel contact within the tactical range, choosing the closest 5 of them. On each, it will evaluate them as units assemblies (not DCS groups) by proximity of 1 km each. For each assembly, it will consider units type total strenght.
    2. After evaluation, different solutions are considered if enemies are within 8 km range:
        - If an enemy units assemblies is significantly stronger than the group, it won't intervene or, if own group is arty, it will consider repositioning away from them (80% threat range or 15 km, the lesser).
        - If an enemy units assemblies is significantly weaker than the group or non-threatening type (i.e. arty, air defences), and the group is a mover, it will plan a route to attack them and exploit the weakness.
        - If an enemy units assemblies is similar in strength and the group is a mover or recce and the enemy is in arty range (but not suitable target), it will reposition to have a direct LOS on enemy.
        These actions are executed by the executeActions function..
    
    3. if enemies are from 8 to 15 km away: 
        - If an enemy units assemblies is significantly weaker or similar strenght than the group or non-threatening type (i.e. arty, air defences), and the group is a mover, it will get closer up to 6 km.

    4. in any case where enemies are not attacked or engaged, C2 will open a task in the F10 menù for clients with relevant informations: target position, number & type, enemy known air defences within 50 km (bearing and range from tgt)

--###### DB CONSTRUCTION & HANDLING ################################################################

--[[ DB structure
    each db element is added as this: [objectID] = {group = Group Object, class = Result of getGroupClass function, i = index in table}
    They're not array to speed up the object calls when needed, cause you can simply do a referencedDB[objectID] call w/o coding for table loop
    when a db is referred to a unit, to skip units loop in the group (i.e. droneunitDb), the "group" key is replaced by "unit"

    DBs are used mostly for FSM loops, that are needed to keep a low impact on the process (FSM 1st level will loop db's, while FSM 2nd level will loop each entry one every phaseCycleTimer timer (default 0.2 seconds)).
    Not all the DBs are used in loops, some are only event-related like the ones used for dismount options.

--[[ FSM is the key element that allow this script to be as lightweight as possibile (for my low skills), cause basically make all the recurring functions to run each every "n" time instead of all-together at once every second. 
    There are 2 levels of FSM:
    - 1st level is the "bigger" one that is divided in phases: each phase update a DB table, plus a fourth one that handle the artillery groups fire missions.
    - 2nd level is the "group cycle", that handle each database entry update.

    Each time a 2nd level cycle is complete, the subsequent 1st level start and at the end it will simply re-start from the first. Check AIEN.performPhaseCycle() for 1st level cycle.
